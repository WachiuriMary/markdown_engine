# markdown_engine
This is a simple markdown conversion application that takes in customer details from the database as input, converts it to markdown then further converts the markdown to HTML. 
The application has been created using Python language, specifically Anaconda. To enable conversion from markdown to HTML, the markdown module was also installed. The database management system used was SQLite which is built into Python. Visual Studio Code was used for development. 
This application uses an existing database that contains details of customers, that is, their names and emails as the input. After the records are retrieved from the database, they are stored in the newly created markdown file. The generated markdown is then converted to HTML and stored in a newly created HTML file. When the application is run two files are generated: a markdown file and an HTML file. Since the records are stored in a table, the markdown is formatted as a table and during conversion the extension; markdown.extensions.tables; is used in order to get the output as a HTML table. 
The application can be further developed to take in dynamically generated records whereby a user interface could be created to enable the users to easily enter new customer details and get updated markdown and HTML output files. Since the program has been built using Python, the interface could be created using Tkinter or PyQt5.
